### Overview:
What is English Studies? This course takes an open and exploratory approach to answering that question as it considers past, present, and future directions of work in and around the field. Partly a history of the field, partly an introduction to the work of English studies and life in the academy, partly a foray into library and archival research, and partly a consideration of new digital methods in literary studies, the course aims to offer a broad introduction to the doctoral student experience and to limn some of the paths that students might take in their careers. Students will be expected to participate fully in the course, which includes online discussions, bibliographic and archival research assignments, an in-class presentation, and a final paper relevant to one of the main areas of the course.
